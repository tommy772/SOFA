SOFA - A Simple App Project

SOFA is an iOS app that aims to provide a collection of various games for socializing, parties, card games, and more. It serves as a knowledge hub for game enthusiasts, offering rules, instructions, and details about different games.

Introduction

SOFA is a project born out of a passion for games and the desire to share that knowledge with others. The app is designed to be a comprehensive repository of games, organized into different categories, including card games, social games, family games, party games, and drinking games. Each category contains a list of games along with their respective rules, requirements, number of players, and duration. The card games in the app are played using a standard 52-card deck.

Target Audience

The app is primarily targeted towards the general public interested in discovering and playing various games. While some categories, such as drinking games and children's games, may not be suitable for all audiences, the app aims to provide a diverse selection that caters to different preferences. However, there is still uncertainty regarding the inclusion of children's games and drinking games in the same app, since they don’t really go hand in hand.

Usage and Features

-	When launching the app, users are presented with a folder view interface that showcases different game categories.
-	Users can explore each category to discover games that interest them.
-	Within each game, detailed rules, instructions, and additional information are provided to guide players.

Development Status

-	There are some issues with the "group" function that need to be addressed im not sure how to fix it
-	The app’s color scheme and icon are yet to be finalized.

Next Steps
-	The app will include the ability for users to add games to their favorites folder for easy access.
-	Im Consider using an AI-powered text-to-speech feature that allows users to listen to the rules instead of reading them.
-	I want to Include two buttons on the start page: one providing a brief explanation of the app and the other allowing users to provide feedback.

Contributing and Feedback

As a beginner developer, I highly appreciate your feedback, suggestions, and contributions. Feel free to provide guidance, tips, or ideas to enhance the app's structure, functionality, or user experience. Since this is my first time making an app and writing Swift, I am unsure of the quality of my work thus far.

Thank you, Tommy
