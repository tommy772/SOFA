## CONTRIBUTING

I would greatly appreciate any help you can provide. Here's a list of things that are currently on my mind:

- First and foremost, I am unsure if the way I have structured the main code is efficient or optimal, so I would appreciate someone reviewing that.

- I am encountering some errors that I believe are connected to the "group" function and the "if" statements.

- Additionally, I would like to include two buttons on the start page: one for a brief explanation of the app and another for users to provide feedback.

- If someone has a good eye for design or colors, any improvements to enhance the design of the start view would be welcome.
